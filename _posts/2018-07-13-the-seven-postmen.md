## Watch the lecture

[Neil Postman][npbio] was a brilliant and enlightening writer, teacher, and
speaker. He's well known for his 1985 book, titled *Amusing Ourselves to
Death*. As great as it is, I like his 1993 book even more, which is titled
*Technopoly*. The subtitle of that book is also the title of a lecture he gave
in 1997. Here's the video recording of that lecture, uploaded by the College of
DuPage in Chicago.

## Enduring questions

Postman offers seven questions for the sceptical mind to evaluate new
technology. His prefatory remarks are brilliant, as are all of his
justifications for putting forth these particular questions. For the sake of
convenience, I'll paraphrase them below before going any further.

1. What is the problem being solved?
2. Whose problem is it?
3. What new problems might be created by solving it?
4. Which people and what institutions might be harmed?
5. What changes are being promoted in language?
6. Which people and what institutions acquire new powers?
7. What alternative media might be made?

He makes the point wisely that the answers will certainly vary based on who is
answering, but the questions will endure. It's not hard to see why these are
lasting questions. They nudge you along a logical and succinct thought process,
which also makes them an excellent checklist. Regardless of what your answers
end up being, by addressing these questions when evaluating new technology you
gain a deeper understanding than reverting to in-built biases. The horizon in
your mental landscape gets pushed back a little bit, revealing dense forests
that you never knew had existed all along.

More than 20 years after Postman's lecture, these questions are more relevant
than ever before. Evidently, social media never underwent any such questioning
by the billions of mindless users. It seems likely that self-driving cars will
be adopted en masse without much enquiry as to *what exactly is the problem
that is being solved*? To be fair, not all new technologies get adopted
unquestioned. I think [cryptocurrency][cclink] has been scrutinised carefully,
and its best feature now seems ripe for widespread adoption (i.e., the
[blockchain][bclink]).

## Some epistemology

On a broader note, Postman's lecture made me ponder the unusual effectiveness
of asking questions as a means to gaining knowledge. It does link back to the
school of sceptics, I suppose. Nothing all that new. But I dug around a bit and
came across an excellent essay by Postman in the journal ETC, titled *Language
Education In A Knowledge Context*. You can read a grainy PDF copy
[here](http://neilpostman.org/articles/etc_37-1-postman.pdf). "I would expect",
Postman says, "very little resistance to the claim that in the development of
intelligence nothing can be more 'basic' than learning how to ask productive
questions". He goes on to further explain:

> Thus I find it necessary to repeat two obvious facts about
  question-asking. The first is that all our knowledge results from questions,
  which is another way of saying that question-asking is our most important
  intellectual tool. I would go so far as to say that the answers we carry
  about in our heads are largely meaningless unless we know the questions that
  produced them. The second fact is that questions are language. To put it
  simply, a question is a sentence. Badly formed, it produces no knowledge and
  no understanding. Aptly formed, it leads to new facts, new perspectives, new
  ideas.

I strongly recommend reading that entire essay. Like the lecture, it's time
well spent on both entertainment and enlightenment simultaneously. Postman
makes a number of arguments that I agree with wholeheartedly. His writing is
always lucid and lively. Hence I am incapable of paraphrasing them. Just read
the original text, as any sceptic would do.


## Remembering to ask

I've internalised the seven questions in the form of an image: the seven
postmen. It helps me to remember that I need to ask these questions and
straighten out my garbled thought process, as if I'm assembling the fragments
delivered by various postmen into a complete message.
