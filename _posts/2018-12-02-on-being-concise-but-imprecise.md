I came across a sentence today that derailed my train of thought, and forced me
into an afternoon of quietly pondering the meanings of T. S. Eliot's poem
[*Burnt Norton*][eliotpoem]. The culpable sentence is simply this: "The title
is a concise, but sometimes imprecise, description of the rule". It's from the
second paragraph of the introduction to a coding standard for the C programming
language, available [here][seilink]. In the realm of software development,
coding standards (and the rules therein) are often the saviour of programmers,
but they are also utterly banal rest of the time. This particular standard is
closer to the former, I think, as it relates to the security and fortification
of programs written in C. It goes without saying, at this point, that I have
yet to fully read said coding standard, as I am still sojourning in the kingdom
of poetry following the derailment today.

What that sentence provoked in me was the penetrating ideas that Eliot
expressed in the final part of *Burnt Norton*. "Words move", wrote Eliot,
"Words strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden, / Under the
tension, slip, slide, perish, / Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place,
/ Will not stay still".  Although this poem is a deeply religious meditation by
Eliot, it nonetheless lends itself to a secular interpretation, particularly in
the isolated context of words and meanings. I first read it a few years
ago. Since then I've enjoyed revisiting it to learn anew its concise evocation
of the imprecise character of words. To that end, the triggering sentence that
I quoted earlier captures my view of this poem beautifully: *concise, but
imprecise*.

The dictionary definitions of *concise* and *imprecise* are not quite polar
opposites, but not too far off either. I suppose conciseness is synonymous with
succinctness, or even compactness. So it's really about length (or lack
thereof), more than the precision of meaning. Hence imprecision can coexist in
harmony with concision. Poets appear to understand this better than the rest of
us. Indeed, one may argue that that's exactly what every poem is.

It's curious that programming connects to poems, at least while mired aboard an
elusive train of thought in my mind - easy, it is, to put a finger on;
difficult, it is, to express in words. Perhaps Yoda would say it more
concisely, though not more precisely. As Eliot pointed out, words "will not
stay still" when we are trying to put a finger on "the still point of the
turning world". I like to state this as the *Uncertainty Principle* for natural
languages, which postulates that a thought translated into words becomes
irreducibly fuzzy.

Now, admittedly, that's a heinously arrogant assertion. Who am I to contend
that the writings throughout the ages, and by the sages, are not both concise
*and* precise? Whatever the predilection one happens to possess, it's hard to
envisage the unambiguous expression of a thought in words when contrasting the
networked structure of thoughts with the simpler, tree-like structure of words
and sentences. This, indeed, is the curious link between programming and
poems. Steven Pinker's books on language explain this very well - most recently
he had an excellent chapter about this in *The Sense of Style* (2014). The gist
of it is that a network (or web) contains more information than its
corresponding tree. Consequently, something must get lost when translating a
web into a tree, when expressing a thought in words, or when compressing a bit
to it. Concision begets imprecision, and it is forever thus.
