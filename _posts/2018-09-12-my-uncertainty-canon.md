I prefer to stay away from book reviews, just not my thing. I learnt long ago
that people review a book by trying to answer the wrong question: _why should
anyone **buy** this book_? But the instructive question is _why should anyone
**read** this book_? Even though I've bought (and continue to buy) lots of
books, I only care about the second question. Needless to say that I've read
far more books than I've bought. My justification for buying any given book is
always convenience, which is totally unrelated to my justification(s) for
reading that book.

However, that being said, it's definitely useful to review my canon of
uncertainty for the sake of posterity. These are the books that have moulded my
thinking about uncertainty, risk, and decision making. I find them immensely
enlightening, and would strongly recommend them to everyone for reading. Below
are my brief remarks for each book, presented in the order that I read them
(but note that the copyright year listed in each citation is for reference
only).


## _Predictably Irrational_ (2008) by Dan Ariely

I read this book in late 2009. I initially saw Ariely's TED talk on YouTube,
then borrowed the book from a library, and eventually bought it for
convenience. It introduced me to psychology research and behavioural
economics. Ariely wrote about all sorts of cognitive biases that made a mockery
of the economic orthodoxy concerning human rationality. The spooky thing was
that I recognised pretty much all the biases in myself. So it was a revelation
about how I tended to be mistaken whenever making decisions in a hurry. It made
me question the value of intuition, and I started to distrust my intuitions
about most things. This book was also the first time that I came across the
work of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.


## _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ (2011) by Daniel Kahneman

I read this book in early 2012. I bought it straight away for reading, because
I was already convinced about the truth in Kahneman's research. This is an
absolutely astounding book. It fleshed out all the ideas that I had begun to
comprehend from psychology research. It changed my daily vocabulary, as
Kahneman overtly intended in the book. I now routinely try to rein in my System
1 and give more time to my System 2 when faced with judgement under
uncertainty. Even though Kahneman said he's pessimistic about anyone being able
to improve their thinking after understanding his research, I find it very
useful just being aware of the cognitive biases that he and Tversky
uncovered. It's a matter of discovering my ignorance in spite of often failing
to cure that ignorance.


## _Antifragile_ (2012) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

This was the first book of Taleb that I read in late 2013. I immediately
proceeded to read all his other books up to that point (especially _The Black
Swan_). I've found his conception of antifragility as _limited loss plus
unlimited gain_ to be the most insightful way of tackling uncertainty and
risk. It helps me pick the right option when faced with a dizzying array of
choices. It also eliminates a great deal of ex post facto regret due to the
hindsight bias. Taleb's expositions of fat-tail and multi-fractal statistics
are second to none. His mathematical papers are excellent supplement to his
books. He has an aphoristic writing style that lends itself to memorable one
liners everywhere. Indeed, his short book _The Bed of Procrustes_ is an
entertaining collection of original aphorisms.


## _The Signal and the Noise_ (2012) by Nate Silver

This is the best non-technical book I've read (first in late 2013) about
Bayesian statistics and probabilistic thinking. Silver discussed numerous
domains of forecasting, some accurate and some hopeless. His main conclusion
was to imagine multiple possibilities first, then apply Bayesian techniques to
estimate a posterior probability distribution. So instead of predicting a
narrow range of possibilities, it's far better to focus on as broad a range as
possible while always remembering that any associated probability is never
certain (i.e., never 0 and never 1, but something in between). A key lesson I
learnt from this book is the remarkable value of Monte-Carlo Simulation, which
is a powerful tool for grappling with complex uncertainties in life.


## _Stumbling on Happiness_ (2005) by Daniel Gilbert

I read this book in late 2017, but I wish I had read it much earlier. In any
case, it answered a bunch of important questions that I had about imagination
and memory. Gilbert explained brilliantly how our imagination systematically
failed, and how our memory was flawed as well. The two of them typically
combine to create a pernicious situation where we become convinced about our
future happiness, only to be disappointed when the time comes. His sense of
humour shone brightly, and the book was a pure joy to read. I now have a deep
curiosity to study Gilbert's research, because it is intensely illuminating.
