excerpt    : Three documentaries that are unequalled.

Whenever I come across a claim that "YouTube grows its total video footage by a
hundred hours every minute", I have to do a double take and ponder: is that
even physically possible? I suppose it is. Still, this is a misleading claim
due to the mismatch of units. There was a time (still is?) when film was
measured in feet (hence the phrase "video footage"). Perhaps the modern
equivalent is gigabytes, or even terabytes. Certainly makes more intuitive
sense to claim that "YouTube grows its total video footage by X terabytes every
minute" (substitute an appropriate value for X). But I do see the advertising
appeal of the former claim, however misleading it happens to be.

Anyway, this line of thought was triggered by a phrase in the Foreword of Jacob
Bronowski's book *The Ascent of Man* (1973), which accompanied the eponymous
BBC documentary. It also got me thinking about my favourite documentaries, all
of which were shot in the 1970s when film was measured in feet. The first was
indeed [*The Ascent of Man*][bronowski], followed by [*Connections*][burke]
(1978) and then [*Cosmos*][sagan] (which first aired in 1980, but was shot
earlier in 1979). These three remain unequalled to this day, in my opinion. No
other documentary approaches the enlightenment offered by these three.

I have finally fulfilled a long-time goal of owning their corresponding
books. Bronowski, Burke and Sagan were not only outstanding hosts of the
respective documentaries, but they also wrote lucidly, and with immense
foresight. For example, I'm astonished how Burke foresaw privacy violations by
hi-tech companies way back in 1978! Sagan's opening definition of *the cosmos*
is pure poetry to go with the stunning introductory scene. Bronowski also
supplied a timeless opening statement in defining his chosen title. They are
simply the best storytellers that I have come across in this genre.
