Doubt is a thinking tool that has unfortunately morphed into an emotion:
fear. Everyday language uses the word doubt with all sorts of negative
connotations that are unwarranted. People see doubt as indecision, dithering,
confusion, hesitation, etc. Those tend to then collectively accelerate towards
fear. Thus missing out on a truly marvellous tool, because fear trumps
thinking.

*The clarity of doubt* reads like an oxymoron, and a phrase which only a moron
might utter. But it is, in fact, a memorable way of stopping oneself from
missing out on the benefits of such a brilliant thinking tool. The key insight
is that of negation: reason by subtracting, not by adding. Doubt forms the
basis of the modern scientific method by elevating the concept of
falsification, which holds that one can only disprove a hypothesis but never
prove it outright. It's only possible to be certain about being wrong, never
about being right. Therein lies the clarity, whereby one can know what is false
with certainty, and act accordingly.

Doubt is the instigator of Bayesian reasoning under uncertainty. A belief that
has yet to be proven wrong gains favour over time until it is decisively proven
wrong. If that time never comes then that belief simply has a high credence, as
opposed to having 100% certainty. In fact, doubt also makes it intuitive that a
belief that has been proven wrong can still function well as an
approximation. This is indeed what happens in physics, e.g., Newton was proven
wrong but his theory remains an excellent approximation.

Cognitive psychology has shed light on the fact that people resolve dissonance
in their heads by affirmation, i.e., doubling down on one belief and completely
denying the alternative. This is also known as the confirmation bias, with
which everyone is born. The scientific method guards against this
explicitly. So the rigorous way to resolve a cognitive dissonance is to reason
by negation. That is, first discard both beliefs that are creating the
dichotomy. Then take the Bayesian approach to build up evidence in favour of
one or the other belief, and never ignore counter-evidence to the favoured
belief.

Doubt never stops one from acting with conviction. Instead, it forces one to
ensure that a strongly held belief is not provably wrong. That doesn't mean the
belief is automatically right, because beliefs lie in a spectrum from wrong to
right, with the only certainty residing on the wrong end. Therefore, the
salient question to ponder always is *Am I wrong?* This is all too often
mistaken for being sheepish, or lacking in confidence, etc. But enlightenment
and wisdom are the friends of only those who dare to doubt. That requires
courage, and humility. Never fear.
