I had never come across the word _gumption_ prior to stumbling upon Nick
Offerman's titular [book][offermanbook] (disclosure: I have yet to read said
book at the time of this post, as I'm awaiting its delivery). This word has an
effortful pronunciation whose sonic decay is inversely proportional to the
vocal energy dispensed by its utterer. It ends with a thump, and a thud. The
aftersound is barely audible to my deficient ears. One could argue that its
meaning echoes its sound, i.e., a borderline onomatopoeia. My only beef is that
a corresponding verb _gump_ does not exist.

Anyhow, it would be wise to take this opportunity and note for my future self
the edible pleasure of learning such a wicked word. Any growth of one's
vocabulary in adulthood ought to be a bona fide cause for celebration,
especially if said vocabulary is prone to intermittent shrinkage. And to
elongate the food analogy ceaselessly, such shrinkage may be thought of as
linguistic malnutrition. Hence the requisite relief of malnourishment that only
a new word can provide. This raises a curious question: what constitutes a
feast regarding the nourishment of one's vocabulary? Food..ahem...for thought,
I reckon.
