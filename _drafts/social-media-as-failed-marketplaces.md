[Alvin E. Roth][rothhome] is an economics professor at Stanford, and shared the
[2012 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics][rothnobel]. He focuses on designing
markets, which he regularly blogs about over [here][rothblog]. I recently read
his brilliant book *Who Gets What - And Why?* (2015). It improved my
understanding of the mechanisms at play in both successful and failed
marketplaces. Subsequently, I've been pondering the central question that he
poses, except in the context of social media: *who gets what in social media -
and why?*

## The art of designing markets

In the October 2007 issue of Harvard Business Review, Roth published
[this][rothpaper] eponymous article, where he states that "A primary motive for
market design is the need to address market failures". He goes on to say that
markets need to do at least the following three things for proper functioning.

> 1. They need to provide *thickness*—that is, to bring together a large enough
> proportion of potential buyers and sellers to produce satisfactory outcomes
> for both sides of a transaction.
>
> 2. They need to make it *safe* for those who have been brought together to
> reveal or act on confidential information they may hold. When a good market
> outcome depends on such disclosure, as it often does, the market must offer
> participants incentives to reveal some of what they know.
>
> 3. They need to overcome the *congestion* that thickness can bring, by giving
> market participants enough time—or the means to conduct transactions fast
> enough—to make satisfactory choices when faced with a variety of alternatives.

In addition, Roth makes a clear distinction between the typical commodity
markets, such as share markets, and matching markets, such as clearinghouses
for newly graduated doctors seeking residencies at hospitals. His focus is on
matching markets, where it isn't enough for one to choose, one has to also be
chosen in return. These markets comprise transactions based on two-sided
matching preferences, not simply price alone. His major research contributions
have been in such matching markets that he helped design. For example, he
worked with surgeons in America to setup kidney exchanges that saved thousands
of lives, and continue to save lives today.

One other thing Roth has popularised is that *repugnance* is a constraint in
such matching markets. Consider the example of a kidney exchange based on
voluntary participation, as it is illegal to buy or sell human organs in nearly
every country. Hence any kind of organ exchange is strictly treated as a mutual
gift. However, the prohibition of putting a price on human organs is not
something that would automatically harm those who are not involved in the
actual transaction, although there are plenty of future possibilities of harm
that Roth discusses in detail. So repugnance is attached to a transaction that
some people would like to engage in, but which is forbidden by everyone else
even if it harms no one (at least not immediately).

Roth doesn't take sides on the issue of whether repugnant transactions ought to
be allowed or not. Instead, he does an excellent job of articulating and
explaining the choices that a society has, in the hope that better decisions
will be made. I'm finding it very instructive to use his framing of
marketplaces and their designs for better understanding a number of topical
phenomena. The privacy violations by Facebook during 2018 is one such
phenomenon that has been on my mind lately. But before focusing on the failures
of Facebook (and social media by proxy), the pertinent question is whether or
not social media are marketplaces?


## Social media are marketplaces

I definitely think that social media are marketplaces, because they bring
together users and advertisers. The buzzword *platform* is now ubiquitous for
describing social media, but I think it's imperative to use the more accurate
(and honest) term *marketplace*. A platform like Facebook does nothing more
than mach advertisers to users - it's not an oversimplification; rather, it's
the exact truth. So marketplace is the word that I'll use from now on.

The profitability of Facebook indicates that it has succeeded in doing the
three things that Roth pointed out (which I quoted above). There's definitely
thickness, in terms of a large number of users and advertisers. Facebook has
convinced users to honestly divulge a huge amount of private and sensitive
information about themselves, so that highly targeted adverts can be displayed
to each user. The speed and scale of Facebook's infrastructure have clearly
removed any kind of congestion from the marketplace, at least as far as
advertisers are concerned. I'll also include LinkedIn and Twitter as same sort
of marketplaces, even though they focus on different aspects of each user.


## Failures of social media

Now, here's an interesting question: if social media marketplaces are so highly
profitable, they must surely be successful? Not necessarily. I think companies
like Facebook have *coerced* users into honestly divulging their private
information in exchange for free storage and messaging. Most users have no idea
that it's the advertisers in these marketplaces who get to choose exactly what
they want. So it only appears as though social media marketplaces are *safe*
for both users and advertisers, in terms of the definition provided by Roth
earlier. However, I think we learned during 2018 that social media marketplaces
are evidently *unsafe* for users, because of the enormous violations of privacy
and trust perpetrated by the middlemen involved (e.g., Facebook).

Unsafe marketplaces can lead to a counter-intuitive form of congestion that
Roth discusses in his book and papers. In the context of social media, I think
this manifests as the humongous proliferation of lies and false information,
which in turn leads to a distortion of how users interact with each other, and
with advertisers. If there's zero incentive for truth and trust in a
marketplace, then participants have to carefully strategise about their
choices, presuming that they are capable of being rational. However, cognitive
biases in humans mean that we end up making systematic errors. For instance,
repetition of a truth can induce people to become desensitised and accept it as
a lie instead (see Daniel Gilbert's 2018 paper about prevalence-induced concept
change). Subsequently, if it becomes a norm that every piece of fact is taken
to be a lie by default, any truth will be so much harder to acknowledge;
thereby leading to the kind of polarisation we are witnessing nowadays in
social media.


## Designing better social media

Admittedly, I'm speculating above regarding what caused social media to become
failed marketplaces. However, the privacy violations are indisputable, and must
be corrected. But I think the current spate of suggestions about governments
regulating Facebook will end up making a bad situation much worse. The solution
that seems most promising to me is the art of designing markets. Applying the
framework that Roth has developed might just give us the ideal outcome, where
both users *and* advertisers get what they want. I hope that the Brain Trusts
at Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. are reading his book.
