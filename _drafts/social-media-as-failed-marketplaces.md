## Social media are marketplaces

Establish buzzword "platform" as synonymous with "marketplace", where a
middleman matches users to advertises. Transactions occur between advertisers
and middlemen on a monetary basis, while personal data is the currency used
between users and middlemen.


## Failures of social media

Privacy violations make marketplaces unsafe. Advertisers have all the choice,
while users only have an illusion of choice, i.e., one-sided match instead of
two-sided. Users may no longer reveal their true preferences, or even defect
and reduce market thickness.


## Designing better social media

Users get an unfair deal currently by exchanging personal data for free storage
and messaging. Two-sided matching may allow users to safely reveal their
preferences. Misinformation is a form of congestion - so find a way to raise
the signal above the noise.
