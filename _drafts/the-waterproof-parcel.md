## Angel wings on a box

In the film *Cast Away* (2000), there's a poignant scene where Chuck (played by
Tom Hanks) is floating on his makeshift raft, emaciated and barely conscious,
along with his only friend Wilson. Then Wilson becomes untethered and begins to
drift away. When Chuck realises this, he desperately tries to retrieve Wilson,
but returns to the raft empty-handed after almost drowning in the process.
Wilson keeps ebbing and flowing with each undulating ocean ripple, beyond the
reach of a distraught Chuck, just as any volleyball would in such
circumstances.

Near the end of the film, Chuck returns the unopened box that he had been
protecting all along. The journey of that box is what I think of as *the
waterproof parcel*. It's an image that invites one to dream up many
possibilities, if only then to ignore them all, before settling on the magical
assumption that a parcel will travel across oceans. Its exact route is deemed
irrelevant, so long as it reaches its destination, or returns to its sender,
undamaged and unopened.

The threats of reality are somehow vanquished by stencilling angel wings on a
box, if *Cast Away* is to be taken literally. Even figuratively speaking,
ignoring reality is both marvellous and flawed. The crossroads of these forces
fascinates me endlessly, much as Chuck is rhetorically left standing on one at
the end of *Cast Away*. How is ignorance bliss? And when does it give one the
blues? Is its absence doomed to drown one in a sea of details? Can it be
harnessed as a deliberative, reflective thinking tool?
