We tend to have a static conception of probability, something like a coin toss,
or a dice roll, or even a lottery. [Stochastic processes][stochproc] encompass
a dynamic conception of probability. So they necessarily deal with changes in
probability over time and across space. The technical language is rather terse
for precisely defining and working with such processes. Definitely not the sort
of thing that I like to blog about. But delving into the intuitive side of
stochastic processes is stimulating stuff!

Incidentally, the title of this post comes from a [poem][emilypoem] by Emily
Dickinson. It eloquently hints at the intuitions that are necessary for
understanding stochastic processes. She managed to express a living, morphing,
breathing image of time and space, in just a dozen succinct lines. That's the
metaphoric essence of anything which is dynamic and random. It is born. It
breathes. It lives. And it even dies!  Throughout all that, it's made of many
different instances, or "Nows". I cannot ever hope to asymptotitcally approach
Dickinson's immeasurable imagination. The best I can do, instead, is illuminate
three examples that I carry around in my head to help me cope with the
complexities of a world that is dominated by stochastic processes.

## Forecasting tomorrow's weather

Gerd Gigerenzer's book *Risk Savvy* (2014) makes a clever point about the
chance of rain tomorrow, e.g., what does a 30% chance of rain tomorrow actually
mean? Without any further clarification, you might interpret it along the
following lines.

1. Around 30% of the suburbs will experience rain at some point tomorrow, but
there's no indication as to which ones.

2. Around 30% of the meteorologists in the committee agree that it will rain at
some point tomorrow, but there's no consensus as to when.

Even though it's a simplified example, it nonetheless illustrates an important
difference between static and dynamic views of probability. On the one hand, a
static view of probability means that the two interpretations above are
mutually exclusive: so it's either the first or the second, but not both. On
the other hand, a dynamic view means that both are valid along with the added
specification of *where* and *when* it's likely to rain.

The dynamic view is indeed what modern [weather forecasting][weatherlink]
uses. Giant supercomputers run regular simulations of the fluid-dynamical
models corresponding to your local atmosphere and terrain. Thus tomorrow's
forecast informs you about which suburbs are likely to experience rain, as well
as roughly what time of day that's expected, among other variables such as
temperature, humidity, wind, etc. And of course the forecast is regularly
updated to keep pace with the changing atmosphere and latest measurements.

Much has been popularised about the chaotic nature of fluid dynamics (e.g.,
read James Gleick), along with the challenges of accurate weather
forecasting. However, 21st century weather forecasting has become ridiculously
good!  Nate Silver spent a whole chapter on this topic in his book *The Signal
and the Noise* (2012). He said everything that I ever thought of saying about
the accuracy of weather forecasting. But as far as the intuitive side is
concerned, it's worth stating the common knowledge that although tomorrow's
forecast is trustworthy, the ten day forecast is to be taken with a pinch of
salt, because such distant horizons have large uncertainties. And forecasts
covering vast territories are also inconveniently inaccurate, as rural folks
know all too well.

The main explanation behind that common knowledge is [chaos theory][chaoslink],
whereby the errors from numerical rounding of initial measurements compound to
produce vastly different (even contradictory) predictions beyond a small window
of time and space. Even though chaos theory is deterministic and it's the
numerical errors that compound, the uncertainty in its predictions cannot be
eliminated due to the intense sensitivity to starting conditions and our finite
computers. So to make progress with weather forecasting, meteorologists run
lots of simulations and then average the results. This step is akin to
composing forever from nows, as in Dickinson's poem. It's a way of reaching
ever closer to an asymptote that's forever unreachable.
