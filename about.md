Hello, my name is **Alif Wahid**. Welcome to my website! It contains bits and
pieces that interest me. All opinions expressed on this site are my own.

I'm a solopreneur in New Zealand. I've worked as a computer engineer for more than two decades,
and branched out into a solo career as of October 2025. Feel free to get in touch with me via
[Bluesky][bluesky], [Substack][substack], or [Github][github]. I don't use other platforms. And
my gmail is very easy to guess using my first and last names separated by a dot.

For anyone interested, my PhD thesis is openly accessible [here][thesis]. And [DBLP][dblp] lists
my prior research publications. But I'm not an academic and don't write like one either. So my
prior publications are for posterity more than anything else. This website is where you'll find
what I write nowadays: largely focused on physics, philosophy, and poetry, all from an engineering
perspective.

This website is statically generated by [Jekyll][jekyll] (using a modified
version of the [minima][minima] theme), and securely served by [GitHub
Pages][ghpages]. You can get the Git repository [here][repo]. I use the
excellent [MathJax][mathjax] and [D3][d3js] libraries in various posts.
So it's best to enable JavaScript in your browser for optimal rendering.
