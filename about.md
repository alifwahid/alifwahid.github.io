This is my personal blog. It contains bits and pieces that interest me. Feel
free to get in touch via the social media links at the bottom.

This website is statically generated by [Jekyll][jekyll] (using a modified
version of the [minima][minima] theme), and securely served by [GitHub
Pages][ghpages]. You can get the Git repository [here][repo].

I use the excellent [MathJax][mathjax] and [D3][d3js] libraries in various
posts. So it's best to enable JavaScript in your browser for optimal rendering.
