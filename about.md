Hello, my name is Alif Wahid. Welcome to my personal blog. It contains bits and
pieces that interest me. Feel free to get in touch via the social media links
at the bottom (only GitHub and Twitter, as I have no presence elsewhere). For
those interested, my PhD thesis is openly accessible [here][thesis]. Also,
[DBLP][dblp] lists my research publications.

This website is statically generated by [Jekyll][jekyll] (using a modified
version of the [minima][minima] theme), and securely served by [GitHub
Pages][ghpages]. You can get the Git repository [here][repo]. I use the
excellent [MathJax][mathjax] and [D3][d3js] libraries in various posts. So it's
best to enable JavaScript in your browser for optimal rendering.
