This repo contains my personal blog from https://www.alifwahid.com. It's a
Jekyl generated static site, using a modified version of the default minima
theme.

The main changes I made to minima were:
1. Added pagination and navigation links
2. Added lunr.js backed search function
3. Suitably customised header and footer
